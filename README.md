A small client-side tool for encrypting and decrypting messages directly in the browser.  
The site runs entirely in the browser (no server-side crypto) and helps two people exchange encrypted messages using public/private key pairs.

---

## Features

- Generate a key pair directly in the browser.
- Import and save your peer's public key in localStorage for convenience.
- Encrypt and decrypt messages with AES-GCM derived from ECDH.
- Save your private key encrypted with a password in the browser.
- Mobile-friendly UI with notifications and visual effects.
- Public key fingerprints are shown for verification.

---

## Usage

2. Click **Generate key pair** → copy your public key.
3. Send your public key to your peer.
4. Paste your peer's public key in the field → click **Import** and verify the fingerprint.
5. To send a message: type it → click **Encrypt** → copy the ciphertext and send.
6. To decrypt a message: paste the received ciphertext → click **Decrypt**.
7. Optionally, you can **save your private key encrypted by a password** in the browser, so you don't need to re-enter it each time.

## Security notes

- **Keep your private key secret.** Anyone with it can decrypt your messages.
- **Verify public key fingerprints** through another channel to avoid MITM attacks.
- Saving the private key is optional, but if you forget the password, it cannot be recovered.
- Forward secrecy is not provided — rotate keys regularly.
